Guardfile
---------

RSpec guard can be really adapted to all kind of projects.

### Standard node project

``` ruby
guard 'jessie' do
  watch(%r{^spec/.+(_spec|Spec)\.(js|coffee)})
  watch(%r{^lib/(.+)\.(js|coffee)})            { |m| "spec/lib/#{m[1]}_spec.js" }
  watch('spec/spec_helper.js')                 { "spec" }
end
```

### Typical Rails (version < 3.1) app

``` ruby
guard 'jessie' do
  watch(%r{^spec/javascripts/.+(_spec|Spec)\.js})
  watch(%r{^public/javascripts/(.+)\.js})        { |m| "spec/javascripts/#{m[1]}_spec.js" }
  watch('spec/spec_helper.js')                   { "spec" }
end
```

### Typical Rails (version >= 3.1) app

``` ruby
guard 'jessie' do
  watch(%r{^spec/javascripts/.+(_spec|Spec)\.js})
  watch(%r{^app/assets/javascripts/(.+)\.js})    { |m| "spec/javascripts/#{m[1]}_spec.js" }
  watch('spec/spec_helper.js')                   { "spec" }
end
```

Please read [Guard doc](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more information about the Guardfile DSL.

Options
-------

You can pass any of the standard RSpec CLI options using the `:cli` option:

``` ruby
guard 'jessie', :cli => "-f nested" do
  # ...
end
```

### List of available options:

``` ruby
:cli => "-f nested"         # pass arbitrary Jessie CLI arguments, default: "-f progress"
:notification => false      # don't display Growl (or Libnotify) notification after the specs are done running, default: true
```
